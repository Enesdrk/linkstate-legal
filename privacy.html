            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Effective Date: January 7, 2026</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to LinkState. Your privacy is a priority in our system stabilization protocols. This policy
                explains how your data traces are managed.</p>

            <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
            <p>We collect minimal data to ensure system stability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Model, OS version, and unique identifiers used by advertising
                    services.</li>
                <li><strong>Game State:</strong> Progress, coin balance, and joker counts stored locally on your device.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Connectivity Status:</strong> Required for system navigation, reward distribution, and ad
                    serving.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>LinkState integrates the following sub-systems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unity Ads:</strong> Used to provide rewarded energy traces (lives) and system skips. Unity
                    may collect device identifiers (such as IDFA or Android Ad ID) and other data as described in their
                    own privacy policy to serve and personalize advertisements.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> Used to render our core interface protocols.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Most data is stored locally using system-level shared preferences. Removing the application from your
                device will permanently purge these traces unless backed up via OS-level cloud services.</p>

            <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>LinkState does not intentionally target or collect traces from individuals under the age of 13. If you
                believe such data has been logged, please contact us immediately.</p>

            <h2>6. Contact</h2>
            <p>For inquiries regarding these protocols, please reach out via our official developer channels.</p>
