            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Effective Date: January 7, 2026</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Protocols</h2>
            <p>By accessing the LinkState system, you agree to abide by these synchronization protocols. If you do not
                agree, disconnect immediately.</p>

            <h2>2. Network Connection Requirement</h2>
            <p>LinkState requires a continuous internet connection to stabilize its energy network and verify reward
                traces. Usage without a valid uplink is not supported.</p>

            <h2>3. Virtual Assets & Economy</h2>
            <p>Coins, Lives (Energy), and Jokers acquired within the system (via gameplay or rewards) are virtual
                artifacts. They hold no real-world value and are non-transferable.</p>

            <h2>4. Fair Navigation</h2>
            <p>Any attempt to manipulate the system traces, bypass time-locks, or exploit the energy network (including
                ad system manipulation) is strictly prohibited and may result in a permanent system lockout.</p>

            <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>LinkState is provided "as is". We are not responsible for any direct or indirect system failures
                resulting from your usage of the protocols.</p>

            <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>All algorithm designs, visual assets, and LinkState branding are the property of the LinkState Engine
                developers.</p>
